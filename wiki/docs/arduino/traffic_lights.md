# Project Title: Sensored Traffic Lights

This projects repliacates a 1 way traffic situation with 2 sets of traffic lights.

---

## 1. Introduction
This project was built to repliacte a 1 way traffic situation with 2 sets of traffic lights and to implement a sensor to detect the presence of a vehicle and change the traffic light directionality accordingly.

**Key Learning Objectives:**
* 
* Understanding the concept of timing and delay in Arduino
* Creating a decorative light effect using simple hardware

# Project Title: [Knight Rider LED Effect]

This projects repliacates the KITT LED effect from the Knight Rider TV series.

---

## 1. Introduction
This project was built to explore the capabilities of the Arduino platform and to create a decorative light effect that mimics the KITT LED effect from the Knight Rider TV series.

**Key Learning Objectives:**
* Learning how to use arrays to control multiple LEDs
* Understanding the concept of timing and delay in Arduino
* Creating a decorative light effect using simple hardware
