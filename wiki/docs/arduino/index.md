# Arduino Projects Overview

Welcome to my Arduino project hub. This section of the wiki serves as a living documentation library for my hardware experiments, ranging from basic circuit building to future projects of complex automated systems.

Each project listed in the sidebar is documented with a "build-first" approach, ensuring you have everything needed to replicate or learn from the designs.

## What Each Project Includes

To make these guides as helpful as possible, every project page is structured into four main components:

### 1. Project Introduction & Goal
A brief explanation of what the project does, the inspiration behind it, and what problem it solves.

### 2. Materials and Components (Tools & Parts)
A complete list of hardware and tools used, including:

* **Microcontrollers:** (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano, or ESP32)

* **Components:** Sensors, LEDs, resistors, and modules.

* **Tools:** Soldering iron, breadboards, or specific libraries.

### 3. Wiring Schematics & Visuals
Clear, high-resolution wiring diagrams (Fritzing or Schematics) and real-life photos of the completed breadboard or PCB layout to help you visualize the connections.

### 4. Source Code & Logic
Fully commented Arduino (`.ino`) code. I break down the logic of the `setup()` and `loop()` functions so you understand *how* the code interacts with the hardware.

## Getting Started

If you are new to these projects, I recommend starting with the **[Knight Rider](knight_rider.md)** project. It covers the fundamentals of array-based LED control and timing—a staple for any Arduino enthusiast.

## Future Roadmap
I am constantly working on new builds. Upcoming documentation will include:
* IoT Home Automation (ESP8266)
* Ultrasonic Distance Sensors with LCD Displays
* Motor Control for Robotics
