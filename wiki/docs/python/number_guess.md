# Number Guessing Game Built Using Python and Random Library

## Overview
This is a number guessing game using Python that will leverage the Random library to choose a number between 0 and 25 which the player has to guess. The player has 5 tries to get it right. If the player guesses the number the game will end with a success message, if the player runs out of tries, the game ends with a failure message.

## Tools / Tech used
* Python 3.10*
* Random Library*
* Antigravity*

## 1. Open a code editor of choice, I will be using Google's Antigravity

This is what your screen should look like more or less if using Antigravity. 
*Note that on the right hand side you will usually find Agent pane, I have it closed.*
*NB! To turn off VScode auto suggestions, open settings, search for inlinesuggestions.enable and toggle it false.*
*This setting also appears in Antigravity, however it did not actually turn off the auto suggestions.*
