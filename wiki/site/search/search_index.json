This section of the wiki serves as a living documentation library for my hardware experiments, ranging from basic circuit building to future projects of complex automated systems. Each project listed in the sidebar is documented with a \"build-first\" approach, ensuring you have everything needed to replicate or learn from the designs. What Each Project Includes To make these guides as helpful as possible, every project page is structured into four main components: 1. Project Introduction & Goal A brief explanation of what the project does, the inspiration behind it, and what problem it solves. 2. Materials and Components (Tools & Parts) A complete list of hardware and tools used, including: Microcontrollers: (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano, or ESP32) Components: Sensors, LEDs, resistors, and modules. Tools: Soldering iron, breadboards, or specific libraries. 3. Wiring Schematics & Visuals Clear, high-resolution wiring diagrams (Fritzing or Schematics) and real-life photos of the completed breadboard or PCB layout to help you visualize the connections. 4. Source Code & Logic Fully commented Arduino ( .ino ) code. I break down the logic of the setup() and loop() functions so you understand how the code interacts with the hardware. Getting Started If you are new to these projects, I recommend starting with the Knight Rider project. It covers the fundamentals of array-based LED control and timing\u2014a staple for any Arduino enthusiast. Future Roadmap I am constantly working on new builds. Upcoming documentation will include: * IoT Home Automation (ESP8266) * Ultrasonic Distance Sensors with LCD Displays * Motor Control for Robotics \ud83d\udca1 Contribution & Feedback Since this is a read-only wiki for documentation, if you find a bug in my code or a mistake in a schematic, please reach out via the main website contact form!","title":"Overview"},{"location":"arduino/#arduino-projects-overview","text":"Welcome to my Arduino project hub.

Follow the steps for your operating system below. 1. Check if Python is already installed Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal) and type: python --version (could be python3 --version) If you see something like this: macOS/Linux: zsh: command not found: python or bash: command not found Windows: 'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command This means Python is not installed. If the command returns a version number, as displayed on the image above, then Python is installed. 2. Install Python macOS Download the latest version of Python from the official website . Run the installer and make sure to check the box that says \"Add Python to PATH\". Restart your terminal and try checking for version. Windows Download the latest version of Python from the official website . Run the installer and make sure to check the box that says \"Add Python to PATH\". Restart your terminal and try checking for version. Why add Python to PATH? Adding Python to PATH allows you to run Python from the command line. This is necessary for using pip to install packages. Basically, adding Python to PATH means saving Python commands in a directory where your computer will look for them when you type a command. The difference is when it is not in PATH, you will see something like in step 1, where it says \"zsh: command not found: python\" or \"bash: command not found: python\". This means that the computer cannot find the Python command. When it is in PATH, it will find the Python command, because it is saved in a directory where the computer will look for it. 3.
